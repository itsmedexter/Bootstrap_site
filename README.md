# Project Title
Bootstrap Homework 2

First homework assignment redone using Bootstrap. No seperate local css style sheet. All Bootstrap CSS.

## Getting Started

Open github links to view on browser or repository link for files. 

### Prerequisites

Any web browser can access or view link, repository. Use source-code editor to view html files.

### When hand hits the head

One thing I should have payed attention to is to folow my div endings. One missing, boggled my mind and took several hours of cursing.

Big one was to zero padding and margins when needed. It was driving me mad seeing why is there extra space. I asked Kerwin for a hint, it was the best. I used the Dev tools in the browser. I clicked on the area affected, it showed me padding and margin was there.

Second is keeping the code simple in the portfolio part. If you see begining to end repository of the portfolio.html, you will see major changes in the container which holds the images.

--"col-sm-12 col-md-6" how much to split for each breaking point. Before I just put one thinking it will do everything.

--"img-fluid" forgot to do this for set and image height and width.

--h4 class="bg-info text-white text-center py-1 px-0 mx-0 mb-2" I was putting this in different divs and making the boxes not jive together moving seperatly from each other. Finding I could just do this under the image.
